Some files that the guy that sold me the display gave me

This is meant to work by connecting to the display with and RS-485 (i think) protocol. USB adapter can be used directly from the laptop since it's just a differntial pair so display and laptop can be on different voltages.

The installer I think is the software from the manifacturer used to program the display
